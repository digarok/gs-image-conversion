# Image Conversion Tools for the Apple IIgs
This is a set of random utilities and convertors I've written over the years.  Each on is it's own directory here with a readme, so you'll have to click on the directories to see what a tool does.

Currently I've only added a recently written tool, `full-color`.  I'll try to add others as I start scouring my archives and clean them up.
